# rmflegpain

This project is simple tracking of leg pain incidince and wearing of shorts or
long pants in my air conditioned office.

## Tracking

The `R` code used to generate my tracking spreadsheet is [here](https://github.com/rmflight/rmflegpain/blob/master/vignettes/Tracking%20Spreadsheet.Rmd), and the
actual Google Sheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jkdDm-gkuY4nMjQ2AD8h_A8Qfb0DfzyvBlsvGF1wbaw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Analysis

I expect the analysis to consist primarily of a Chi-square test examining the
expected incidince of painful days based on shorts against the actual days
that I experienced pain.
